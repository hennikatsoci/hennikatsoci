- 👋 Hi, I’m @HennikAtSOCi (AKA [@danhunsaker](https://github.com/danhunsaker)); I'm in the process of changing my name to Hennik, but it's a process, so it'll take some time.
- 👀 I’m interested in making tech work for everyone, and improving existing processes to improve quality of life
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the kinds of work needed by SOCi.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that meets the above goals!
- 📫 How to reach me? Since this is my work persona, dhunsaker@meetsoci.com is probably best, if you're not in our Slack.
